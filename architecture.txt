This file try to explain the structure of the chess engine.
A line starting with a dash (-) is a function.
Words starting with a capital letter are classes.
Words starting with a lower case letter are variables/attributes.
I will probably add more to this file later to include more features when \
I figure out how to implement them.

Position:
	x: int # x position
	y: int # y position
	- __str__(self) -> str # returns an algebraic notation of the position (e.g. a1, b2, c3, etc.)
	- __repr__(self) -> str # returns an algebraic notation of the position (e.g. a1, b2, c3, etc.)

Piece:
	position: Position # position of the piece
	color: str # color of the piece
	name: str # name of the piece
	value: int # value of the piece (used for evaluation)
	has_moved: bool # has the piece moved yet?
	just_moved: bool # was the piece just moved?
	- get_moves(board: Board) -> list # returns a list of all possible moves
	- __str__(self) -> str # returns the color, name and position of the piece (e.g. wPawne4)
	- __repr__(self) -> str # returns the color, name and position of the piece (e.g. wPawne4)

	Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King:
		value = 100,  500,  300,  300,  900,  10000 (respectively)

Config (not a class):
	ROWS: int # number of rows on the board
	COLS: int # number of columns on the board
	WINDOW_SIZE: int # size of the window
	SQ_SIZE: int # size of each square
	PIECE_SIZE: int # size of each piece

Dragger:
	dragging: bool # is the user dragging a piece?
	initial_piece: Piece # the piece that the user is dragging
	self.mouse_position: Position # the position of the mouse in pixels
	self.initial_position: Position # the position of the piece that the user is dragging
	self.mouse_board_position: Position # the position of the mouse in board coordinates
